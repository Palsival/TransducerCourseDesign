# Summary of week 5
## Progress
Combining the informations that we gathered on week 3 and 4, we settled the selection of singlechip and designment of basic circuit.  
## Problems solved
1.Select and purchase for photoelectric switchs.  
2.Model and parameters of singlechip have been settled.  
3.The designment of basic circuit, maybe we'll add a buzzer or LED to work as an alarm.

Esp8266 was adopted as the WiFi moudle, which could realize the computment of speed. It also contains a chip called CH340, it allows us to program and burn with Arduino.

Two pairs of Ompton NPN NO were adopted as photoelectric switchs. The launchs are powered by a battery at the voltage of 11.1V, which contains three 18650 batteries, the receivers are powered along with the WiFi module by USB or 5V1A power bank.  
## Problems to solve
1.The realization of functions by software.   
2.The layout of the circuit.  
3.Serial communicationã€‚  
## Next week's schedule
Finish the program and test of the code.
