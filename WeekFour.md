# Progress summary of week 4  
## Progress  
We've referred to some relevant informations. Now have a fair idea of how the design of circuit will go. Meanwhile, we've figured out the components we might need to realize the function of speed measurement. Now we are at the stage of basic circuit designment and the selection of communication module.   
## Problems solved  
(1) Schematic diagram of photoelectric switch (Launch and receiver)

(2) Using two pairs of  photoelectric switchs to fulfill the function of speed measurement.(v=s/t)  
(3) By introducing another pair of photoelectric switch, we may cover the measurement of acceleration.  
## Problems to solve
(1) Selection of singlechip.  
(2) Accuracy and range of the speed measurement.  
(3) The realization of serial communication with Blue-tooth or WiFi module.
