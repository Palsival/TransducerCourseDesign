# Summary of week 6
## Progress
After purchase for all the components and modules, we built the actual circuit based on what we designed last week. Now we are debuging the code and test the functions.  
## Problems solved
The actual circuit, which contains batteries, launchs, receivers and singlechip, is as follows.

In this image, two launchs are powered by the battert, while on the right side lays the receivers, the WiFi Module and the power bank. It's a pity that only can the result be observed on serial monitor.

## Problems to solve
1.Lack of the object of speed reference, a little car with speed adjustable motor might help.  
2.Test and improve of the circuit.  
3.Complete the code and debug.  
4.WiFi connection, serial communication, sever building, display on mobile phone.  
## Next week's schedule
Improve the code and debug, maybe add some additional functions.  
Attemp to connect the network and build the server.
